'''oops---Python has been an object-oriented language from day one. Because of this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy

Creating Classes:

The class statement creates a new class definition. The name of the class immediately follows the keyword class followed by a colon as follows:

class ClassName: 'Optional class documentation string' class_suite

The class has a documentation string, which can be accessed via ClassName.doc.'''
